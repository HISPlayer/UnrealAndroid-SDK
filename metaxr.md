</p>

- Restart the editor after applying settings. Note: This may require multiple restarts after applying a setting.

Input the license key that is associated with the SDK. If the license key is not valid, the player wonâ€™t work and will throw an error message. To find this field, go to the Level Outliner and look for the HISPlayer_Blueprint actor. Then, on the Details window, look for the HISPlayer section.

### Sample Description
The HISPlayer VR Sample is made based on the Unreal Engine [Virtual Reality Template](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/vr-template-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.3)

The important UI components are located in HISPlayerVRSample\Content\HISPlayerResources\UI:
- **HISPlayer_UI.uasset**: Widget Blueprint of the video playback control UI
- **HISPlayer_UI_Actor.uasset**: Blueprint class to place the **HISPlayer_UI** widget to VR space. The **HISPlayer_UI** is attached as a widget component.
- **HISPlayer_UI_OnClick.uasset**: Represents an abstract game action for **HISPlayer_UI** that can be mapped to Meta Quest left and right hand controllers

</p>

The HISPlayer UI components are connected to the default VRTemplate's device input action mapping (IMC_Default) and Blueprint class (VRPawn) :
- HISPlayerVRSample\Content\VRTemplate\Input\IMC_Default.uasset: The **HISPlayer_UI_Onlick** is mapped in this input mapping context asset. It represents the Meta Quest left and right hand controllers input action for **HISPlayer_UI**.

</p>

- HISPlayerVRSample\Content\VRTemplate\Blueprints\VRPawn.uasset: a Pawn is the physical representation of the user and defines how the user interacts with the virtual world. In the VR Template, the Pawn contains the logic for input events from the motion controllers. You can also control the behavior of Meta Quest left and right hand controller through **WidgetInteractionLeft** and **WidgetInteractionRight**. The Blueprint also controls the UI interaction with the Meta Quest left and right hand controllers emulating the left-mouse click.
